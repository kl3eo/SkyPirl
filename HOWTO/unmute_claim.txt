And I finally did it! I searched 1/2h for old Pirl accounts, and found two keystore files. Another 1/2hr to remember the password and check it with old Pirl binary "attach" console.  Ok, it worked. Now I have a key file and I know that I remember the password correctly - because "personal.unlockAccount" goes "true". Now I go the MEW site in Opera (failed in Firefox on the first attempt! == but Opera is ok) and create a wallet with an unrecommended option "Keystore" - you have to enter the Key file and a password there. Now I get to the MEW dashboard and try to search Pirl in Networks.. fail. No such network. Now I read the nice tutorial how to claim Pirl1.0 coins - it says don't matter, just go on and sign. Yes, sir. I do go on and sign, but.. the "Claim" button in the Pirl explorer stays muted. OK, let's see the reason. Open the developer tab on the right. It says the JSON error is inside the signature - you'll need to manually add "0x" to the "sig" inside the signature message.
